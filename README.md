# Alzheimer

Dementia is one of the diseases that affect the human brain and makes people forget things frequently. To identify the severity, medical doctors need to take an X-ray of the brain, and through that, they come to the conclusion about the critical stage. Instead of doing this job manually, if we can automate it, that could be helpful to the doctor and reduce the workload. This could decrease the error rate that occurs in human interpretations.

To attain this, I took the benchmark image data from the Kaggle repository. It contains X-ray images of the brain for the corresponding severity types. Initially, I struggled to handle the imbalanced classes because of unsatisfying accuracy and performance. After applying some Data Augmentation techniques, I handled the class distributions very well. To achieve better accuracy, the Convolutional Neural Network Architecture was used to extract relevant features and process the images through their convolutional layers.

The developed model classifies the X-ray images of dementia with 96% accuracy.
